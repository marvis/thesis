\chapter{Component trees and Image Segmentation}\label{chapter:cptree} \label{chpt:cptree}
The component tree as a representation of a digital image is a corner stone of the cell tracking algorithm developed in the scope of this thesis. In the cell tracking algorithm, each image is converted into a component tree. Then the component trees are used for so-called tree assignment based cosegmentation. The component tree was introduced to image processing by Jones \cite{jones1999connected}. Najman and Couprie \cite{Najman:04,najman2006building} proposed a fast to construct the component tree, based on Tarjan's union-find procedure. However, the constructed component tree is usually very large, in fact too large for the subsequent tree assignment step. It is observed that most nodes in the component tree are redundant which make the tree really big. In this thesis, I proposed a pruning method which decreases the final tree significantly ($0.1\%$ of the original size).\\
An important prerequisite for the tree assignment procedure, is to compute the weights between every pair of nodes in two component trees. This step is extremely time consuming, which in practice is a major bottle-neck of our cell tracking algorithm. To overcome this bottleneck, we proposed a fast dynamic algorithm which enables a quasi-linear running time improving from $O(|T1|\cdot|T2|\cdot N)$ for a main algorithm to $O(N)$, N denoting the number of pixels in the images.
\section{Component tree construction} \label{sec:cptree-def}
\subsection{Component tree definition}
A component tree $T$ can be described as $T=(V, E)$, where $V$ is the set of nodes (or component nodes) in tree $T$, and $E$ is the inclusion relationship between component nodes. Each component node is mapped to a connected area (or connected component or just component) under some threshold. The relationship between any two component nodes is either inclusion or non-overlapping. However, we only consider the relationship between two nodes $u$ and $v$. That is if area of $u$ includes area of $v$, there will be no other node whose area includes area of $v$ or is included by area of $u$. Fig. \ref{fig:cptree-example} shows the component tree of a very simple image, by considering five different threshold values.

In practice, a component tree usually considers all threshold values with all possible connected components, which is called a \emph{full component tree}.

\label{fig:cptree-example}
\end{figure}
\subsection{The $\alpha$ and $\beta$ area} \label{sec:alpha-beta-area}
Each node $v$ in the component tree is associated with a connected area, which is denoted as its area $\beta(v)$. As the $\beta$ area includes the $\beta$ areas of all its child nodes, we can define the $\alpha$ area of a node which is its $\beta$ area exclusive of all its child nodes. Thus, for each node $v$, we have
$$
\beta(v) = \alpha(v)\cup\bigcup_{v_i \in C(v)} \beta(v_i)   
$$
$$
\alpha(v) = \beta(v) - \sum_{v_i\in C(v)}\beta(v_i)
$$
where $C(v)$ is all child nodes of $v$, $v_i$ is the $i_{th}$ child node of $v$. 

We can find the lowest intensity in the connected component which is called the \emph{level of the connected component}. We also write level ($v$) for the level of the area associated with $v \in V$. Thereby, the $\alpha$ area of a component can also be defined as the set of pixels with intensity equal to the level of the component.
$$
\alpha(v) = \{p \in \beta(v)| I(p) = \mathrm{level}(v)\}
$$
Fig \ref{fig:cptree-alpha} (A) illustrates the relationship between the $\alpha$ nodes and the $\beta$ nodes. It is easy to prove that the $\alpha$ area of all possible component nodes is a partition of the whole image. 
$$
\bigcup \alpha(v) = I
$$

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\label{fig:cptree-alpha}
\end{figure}

As there is no overlap between the $\alpha$ area of any pair of nodes, each image pixel can be mapped to a component node uniquely. Fig.\ref{fig:cptree-alpha}B illustrates the mapping of $\alpha$ node.

\subsection{Quasi-linear algorithm}
The process of constructing component tree is a process of partition the image into many non-overlapping areas ($\alpha$ areas) with relationship. According to this idea, Najman and Couprie \cite{najman2006building} proposed a quasi-linear time to construct a component tree. They utilize the disjoint-set data structure  to represent the discrete $\alpha$ areas.

The algorithm needs only one searching of all image pixels in the order of their intensity from highest to lowest. As the gray "scale" space of images is typically limited to 8 or 16 bit, this can be done in linear time using a bucket sort algorithm.Initially every image pixel is mapped to a disjoint set (element) with parent to itself. And each disjoint set is mapped to a component node with only one pixel, both for its $\alpha$ area and $\beta$ area and no child node. In other word, each image pixel is mapped to a component node through its mapped disjoint set.

When one image pixel with intensity $T$ is processed, we will first find its corresponding disjoint set and component node, see \emph{current component node}; then we check its neighboring pixels. If the neighboring pixel is of intensity larger than $T$, add the component node of the neighboring pixel to the child of current component node. If the neighboring pixel is of equal intensity to $T$, we merge both the disjoint set and child component nodes of both pixels. See alg .\ref{alg:cptree-quasi} for algorithm details.

\textbf{Implementation: } During the implementation,  it is not immediately obvious to get the elements of a disjoint set (or the $\alpha$ area) with only parent and rank information. However, by adding a next node information, this problem can be solved. The next node information links all the elements of a set in a loop, which enables getting the whole set from any element.

\textbf{Running time: } Let $N$ denotes the number of image pixels. The first step is sorting the image pixels. It can be done in $O(N)$ if the weights are small integers \cite{cormen2001introduction}. In the loop, both adding children and merging children and merging disjoint set can be done in constant time. So the total running time is quasi-linear of $O(N)$.

\section{Component tree pruning}
Each image is uniquely mapped to a component tree, and vice verse. Usually the constructed component tree is extremely large (for example 133187 nodes for a microglia image of size $156\times250\times34$ 8 bit). But the tree assignment step only tolerates a tree of size about 200. It is absolutely necessary to prune the component tree before moving into next step.\\
\subsection{Redundancy rate}
The \emph{redundancy rate} of a component tree is defined as the ratio between the size of component tree and that of its corresponding image. For an image of size $N$, the maximum redundancy rate is $100\%$ when each pixel maps to a component node. The minimum redundancy rate is $1/N$ when there is only one node in the tree with the pixels of the whole image. For the microglia above, 133187 nodes for an image of size $156\times250\times34$, the redundancy rate is $10.04$\%.\\
The redundancy rate reflects the structural complexity of an image. High redundancy indicates a noisy image with many small components, whereas low redundancy indicate a clear image with few big components. However, for a component tree with high redundancy rate, a proper pruning process promises to lower the redundancy rate and make the main structure, the objects that we are actually interested in, represent more clearly in the pruned component tree.
\subsection{Identifying redundant nodes}
Fortunately, we find large numbers of redundant nodes from the statistic of a full component tree. There are plenty of nodes with very few pixels and huge number of single nodes, which is the only child of its parent. Figure \ref{fig:cptree-random} displays, it is the full component tree of an image of size only $10\times10$, comprising 79 nodes. The small nodes lead to lots of leaf nodes in the tree. The non branching nodes, henceforth also referred to as \emph{single nodes}, contribute most nodes for the tree and make the tree extremely long with high depth. \\
Small nodes typically indicate connected components resulting from noise, which can be deleted without hesitation. The single node is created in the instance that when the threshold increase, a big component shrinks to a smaller component (the created single node) without breaking into pieces. A path with long single nodes from ancestral node to child node represents the size decreasing tendency of a big ancestral node. The single node without too much change from its parent is not very important and should be deleted.\\
Besides the two main kinds of redundant nodes, there is a third kind, that is the components with huger size which is more than the object size we are interested.

\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{images/cptree_random}
\caption[The full component tree of a random image]{The full component tree of a random image of size $10\times10$ with 79 nodes (redundancy rate 79\%). Noticeably, there are lots of single nodes in the tree}.
\label{fig:cptree-random}
\end{figure}

\subsection{The pruning procedure}
As analysed above, the nodes with too small or too large number of pixels and the single nodes with small changes should be deleted. For the first scenario, the total number of pixels of a node is the number of pixels in its $\beta$ area, named $\beta$ size. We can set a small $\beta$ size threshold, see $mb$ to filter out small nodes and a big $\beta$ size thresh, see $Mb$ to filter out larger nodes. For the second scenario, the changing of a single node from its parent is the $\alpha$ area of its parent node. Similarly, a small $\alpha$ size threshold, see $ma$, is set to prevent the parent nodes from creating new single child nodes.\\
Considering the microglia image of size $156\times250\times34$ as an example, the number of nodes in its full component tree is 133187. After pruning with $mb = 1000$, $Mb = 100000$, and $ ma = 100$, only 188 nodes are left in the pruned component tree, which is 1/708 of the original size. The redundancy rate decreases from 10.04\% to 0.014\%. The size of the pruned component tree can change according to the parameter of $mb, Mb,$ and $ma$. As we will see in Chapter 4, reducing the size of component trees is a crucial step towards making tree-assignment based cosegmentation work in practice. until it fits the requirement of tree assignment.

\subsection{ An Application to image segmentation} \label{sec:cptree-applic}
As mentioned in the section.\ref{sec:thresh-cptree}, the component tree can be  considered to be an advanced thresholding techniques, which is the collection of all possible thresholding components. A major use of the component tree is for image filtering \cite{najman2006building}. Fig .\ref{fig:cptree-flywing} shows the filtering result of a fly wing image. The intensity of wings increase gradually from bottom-left to top-right. It is impossible to segment the objects out with a single global  threshold. With the pruned component tree, however, we can get the filtering result by keeping only leaf nodes.

\section{Weights between component trees} \label{sec:cptree-weight}
\subsection{Weighting function}
An important part of obtaining cosegmentation is to compute certain weights between the nodes of two given component trees $S$ and $T$. A weighting function to be used for cosegmentation, as introduced in \cite{Xiao:2011, xiao2011dynamic}, is the Jaccard index (also know as Tanimoto score)
$$
w_{u,v} = \frac{|\beta(u) \cap \beta(v)|}{|\beta(u) \cup \beta(v)|},
$$
where $u$ and $v$ are nodes from $S$ and $T$ respectively, and $\beta(u)$ and $\beta(v)$ are the areas covered by the node $u$ and $v$, respectively.

\subsection{Dynamic programming for calculating overlap weights}
Before computing tree assignments between two trees as to be introduced in Chapter 4, the weight between each pair of nodes, one in each component tree, needs to be computed. In practice, calculating weights is a major bottleneck for computing cosegmentation. Here, we propose a linear time dynamic programming algorithm for calculating overlap weights between all pairs of vertexes of two trees by systematically utilizing the inclusion relationship of a node and its children in a component tree.

Recall that or each node $v$, $\beta(v)$ denotes the connected area in the image that is
associated with $v$, while $\alpha(v)$ is the connected area of $v$
\emph{excluding} the connect areas of the \emph{children of} $v$. The 
pixels in $\alpha(v)$ belong \emph{exclusively} to $v$ and not to any of its
children. Furthermore, let $v_i$ denote the $i$-th child of node $v$ and
$C(v)$ be the set of children of $v$. Then, we have
\begin{equation*} \label{eqn:beta-disjoint}
\beta(v_i)\cap\beta(v_j)=\emptyset\quad\mbox{for all $v_i\neq v_j\in C(v)$}
\end{equation*}
Hence, $\beta(v)$ can be decomposed as follows:
\begin{equation*} \label{eqn:beta-decompose}
\beta(v) = \alpha(v)\cup\bigcup_{v_i \in C(v)} \beta(v_i)   
\end{equation*}

That is to say, $\beta(v)$ can be \emph{partitioned} into $\alpha(v)$ and
$\beta(v_i)$, $v_i \in C(v)$.  This will be the guiding principle of our
dynamic programing algorithm for weight calculation.

Let $S=(V_S,E_S,\alpha_S,\beta_S)$ be the first component tree, and
$T=(V_T,E_T,\alpha_S,\beta_S)$ be the second component tree whenever clear from context, we will omit suffix in $\alpha_S$, $\alpha_T$, $\beta_S$, and $\beta_T$ and write $\alpha$ or $\beta$ instead. Our task is to compute
the Jaccard index between each vertex $u$ in $S$ and vertex $v$ in $T$, defined
as
\begin{equation*}
w(u,v) = |\beta(u) \cap \beta(v)| ~/~ |\beta(u) \cup \beta(v)|
\end{equation*}
We can rewrite the above as
\begin{equation*}\label{eqn:jaccard-rephrase}
w(u,v) = \frac{|\beta(u) \cap \beta(v)|}{|\beta(u)| + |\beta(v)| - |\beta(u) \cap \beta(v)|}
\end{equation*}
Thus, the weight calculation between vertex $u$ in $S$ and vertex $v$ in $T$ can
be rephrased as calculating intersections between $\beta(u)$ and $\beta(v)$. As
a shorthand notation, we denote the cardinality of the intersection of $\beta(u)$
and $\beta(v)$ as
\begin{equation*}
  \label{eqn:betabeta}
  \beta\beta(u,v) = |\beta(u) \cap \beta(v)|  
\end{equation*}

Similarly, we define 
\begin{equation*} \label{eqn:alphabeta}
\alpha\beta(u,v) = |\alpha(u) \cap \beta(v)|  
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*} \label{eqn:alphaalpha}
\alpha\alpha(u,v) = |\alpha(u)\cap\alpha(v)|
\end{equation*}

Decomposing $\beta(v)$ into $\alpha(v)$ and $\beta(v_i)$, we can split $\beta\beta(u,v)$ into

\begin{equation*} \label{eqn:betabeta-comp}
\beta\beta(u,v) = \alpha\beta(u,v) + \sum_{u_i \in C(u)}\beta\beta(u_i,v),
\end{equation*}
while $\alpha\beta(u,v)$ can be decomposed into
\begin{equation*} \label{eqn:alphabeta-comp}
\alpha\beta(u,v) = \alpha\alpha(u,v) + \sum_{v_i \in C(v)}\alpha\beta(u,v_i),
\end{equation*}

For our dynamic programming algorithm, the idea is to use three dynamic
programming tables $\alpha\alpha$, $\alpha\beta$, and $\beta\beta$. Based on the
dependency relationship between them, we compute them in the following
order:
\begin{equation*}
\alpha\alpha(u,v) \to \alpha\beta(u,v) \to \beta\beta(u,v)  
\end{equation*}

Let $P$ be the set of all pixels in an image, and $T(V,E,\alpha,\beta)$
be its component tree. Its we have already seen in equation (3.1), $\alpha(v)$ is a partition of $P$
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:alpha-decompose}
P = \bigcup_{v \in V}\alpha(v).
\end{equation}

This allows us to define a reverse mapping of $\alpha^{-1}: P \to V$ that
identifies for each pixel $p\in P$ with the unique vertex $v$ that satisfies 
$p\in\alpha(v)$.  This reverse mapping allows us to calculate all
$\alpha\alpha(u,v)$ in time $O(|P|)$. Fig .\ref{fig:cptree-aaweight} illustrates
the decomposition of $\alpha\alpha$ weight calculating.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{images/cptree_aaweight}

trees.]{The decomposition of $\alpha\alpha$ weights between two simple component

area; C. The overlapping $\alpha\alpha$ areas. Each image pixel is mapped to a 
component node in both component tree.}
\label{fig:cptree-aaweight}
\end{figure}

Based on the above recurrence relations, both $\beta\beta(u,v)$ and
$\alpha\beta(u,v)$ can be calculated in a dynamic programming fashion by
post-order traversal of the component trees (see Algorithm 1). This leads to a
time complexity of $O(|S| \cdot |T)$.  

\subsection{Quasi-linear running time}
\paragraph{Worst-case time complexity.} For the whole weight calculation
process, we first compute all $\alpha\alpha$ weights, then the
$\alpha\beta$ weights, and finally the $\beta\beta$ weights, yielding
a total running time of $O(|P| + |S|\cdot|T|)$.  

\def\avg{\mathrm{avg}}

From Eqn.~\eqref{eqn:alpha-decompose}, we get
\begin{equation*}
|V| = \frac{|P|}{\avg_{v\in V}(|\alpha(v)|)} 
\end{equation*}

We always have $|V|\le|P|$, since $\avg_{v\in V}(|\alpha(v)|) \ge 1$.
For large images ($|P| \sim 10^6$) such as the ones considered in Section
\ref{sect:results}, the full component tree contains about $10^5$ vertexes.  
However, after pruning, the tree size decreases dramatically, to typically much
less than $500$, as observed in \cite{Xiao:2011}.  
Usually, for large images, we have $\avg_{v\in V}(|\alpha(v)|) > |V|$, so $|V|^2
\ll |P|$. Under these circumstances, the total running time, dominated by the
number of pixels, is quasi-linear w.r.t $|P|$.
