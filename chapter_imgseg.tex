\chapter{Image segmentation}
For the cell tracking methods which seperate the segmentation and association steps, the segmentation quality influences the whole tracking result significantly. A good segmentation for the objects in each frame is very important especially in the very early frames. Because the segmentation results of priori frame affects the segmentation results of later frames, that the missing-segmentation of an object will be very likely to be miss tracked in later frames.

Image segmentation are basically ad-hoc problems. Different segmentation emphasize one or more of the desired properites. During the past 40 years, hundreds of segmentation algorithms have been proposed\cite{freixenet2002yet}. There are some basic segmentation methods, such as global/local thresholding and some complex segmentation models, such as active contour, chanvese's method , and graph cut method, introduced in this chaper.

In this thesis, I proposed a multi-object segmentation method based on only one level set function as an extension of Dufour \cite{dufour} and Zhang \cite{zhang}'s method. The key idea is partition the whole image into many voronoi areas by fast marching method. Each object lies in only one voronoi area and performs the chanvese's method to do further segmentation. I build an image processing platform with lots of image segmentation algorithms in C/C++, which is distributed as an open source repository.
\section{Thresholding method}
\subsection{Overview}
In digital image processing, thresholding is the mostly used technique for image segmentation due to its easy usage. Normally the thresholding value is a single value which partitions a grayscale image into foreground and background area. It is offen an effective tool to separate objects from the background and it is always the first tried method before applying other complex segmentation methods. One application of thresholding is document image analysis which aims to extract printed characters \cite{kamel1993extraction,abak1997performance}, graphs, or other items. Examples of thresholding applications lies in all kinds of pre-processing or post-processing steps, including edge detection, image feature extraction, distance transform, skeleton extraction, cell tracking and so on. In practice, thresholding can solve most problems. However, a good thresholding value is required.

Although its simplicity, there is no strict defintion for the thresholding of an image. Quite a lot of thresholding techniques \cite{sahoo1988survey, sankur2001image, sezgin2004survey}, more than 44 binary methods, are proposed according to different criterions. Sezgin and Sankur \cite{sankur2001image, sezgin2004survey} categorize thresholding methods into six groups based on different models, that is histogram shape-based methods, clustering-based methods, entropy-based methods, object attribute-based methods, spatial methods, and local methods. Histogram shape-based methods find the thresholding value on histogram data by seperating the peaks and valleys, the representing method is otsu's thresholding method. Clustering-based methods models the foreground and background as a mixture of two gaussians and applys clustering methods to get the two parts. Entropy-based methods utlize the entropy of the foreground and the background regions, as well as the cross-entropy between the original and binarized image, etc. Object attribute-based methods finds a partition which is similar to the gray-level image in some attributes, such as fuzzy shape similarity, edge coincidence, etc. The spatial methods utilize the probability distribution in higher-order and/or correlation between pixels. Local methods calculate a suitable threshold value for each pixel according to the local image characteristics, such as the standard devariance, mean, etc.

As thresholding method is not the main segmentation method in our paper, we only introduce some widely used algorithms. For global thresholding method, otsu's method \cite{otsu1975threshold} is a very elegant method with solid mathematic fomulars by minimize the intra-class variance or maximize inter-class variance. And it is easy to extend otsu's method into multi-thresholding method. For local thresholding, the thresholding is decided by average local gray values and/or standard devariance. 
\subsection{Global thresholding and Otsu's method}
Global thresholding converts a grey-level image into binary image by turning all pixels below some threshold to zero and all pixels above that threshold to one. If $g(x,y)$ is a thresholded version of $f(x,y)$ at some global threshold $T$, 
$$
g(x,y) = \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
  1 & \mbox{if } f(x,y) \ge T \\
  0 & \mbox{otherwise}
  \end{array}
  \right.
$$
To set a global threshold $T$, we usually analysis the histogram profile by finding a valley that seperates two mountains. One mountain for the foreground and one for the background. The histogram of an image is a probability distribution:
$$
p(g) = n_g/n
$$
Where, $n_g$ is the number of pixels with intensity $g$, $n$ is the total number of pixels. There are two ways to decide the global threshold, the iterative method and otsu's method. 

\textbf{Iterative method :} This method compute the global threshold from the initial mean intensity value, then iterative replace the threshold value by the average mean intensity of the foreground and the background regions. See alg\ref{alg:global-thresh} for details of this method.

The main problem for the iterative method is speed. The step for segmenting an image into foreground and background for many times is time consuming.

\begin{algorithm}
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Grey-level image and the histogram}

Repeat 2-4 until $\mu_f$ and $\mu_b$ do not change any more
\caption{Iterative method for global thresholding}
\label{alg:global-thresh}
\end{algorithm}
\textbf{Otsu's method : } Otsu \cite{otsu1975threshold} proposed a method based on selecting the lowest point between two classes. The selected point will minimize the intra-class variance or maximize the inter-class. The intra-class variance is defined as the weighted sum of variances of the foreground area and background area.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:intra-var}
\sigma_w^2(t) = w_b(t)\sigma_b^2(t) + w_f\sigma_f^2(t)
\end{equation}
where $w_f$ and $w_b$ are the probabilities of the two classes seperated by threshold $t$, $\sigma_f^2$ and $\sigma_b^2$ are the variance of foreground and background regions.

Further, Otsu demonstrate that minimizing the intra-class variance is the same as maximizing inter-class variaces:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:inter-var}
\sigma_b^2(t) = \sigma_T^2 - \sigma_w^2(t) = w_f(t)w_b(t)[\mu_f(t) - \mu_b(t)]^2
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_T^2$ is the total variance of the whole image, $\mu_f$ and $\mu_b$ are the mean intensity of foreground and background regions. Here $w_b(t) = \sum_0^tp(i)$, $w_f(t) = 1 - w_b(t)$, $\mu_b(t) = \sum_0^tp(i)x(i)/w_b(t)$, and $\mu_f = (\mu_T - \mu_b(t)w_b(t))/w_f(t)$

By using fomular \ref{eq:inter-var}, the Otsu's method could be designed as dynamic algorithm, and thus will be very fast. The equations for dynamic otsu's method is as follows, 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:otsu-dynamic}
\begin{array}{lll}
	w_b(t) & = & w_b(t-1) + p(t) \\
	w_f(t) & = & \mu_T - \mu_b(t)w_b(t) \\
	\mu_b(t) & = & (\mu_b(t-1)w_b(t-1) + p(t)x(t))/w_b(t)\\
	\mu_f(t) & = & (\mu_T - \mu_b(t)w_b(t))/w_f(t)
\end{array}
\end{equation}
Where $\mu_T$ is the average intensity of the whole image. See alg.\ref{alg:otsu-thresh} for the details. If there are multiple maximum $\sigma_b(t)^2$, the thresold value can be set as the average of them.
\begin{algorithm}
\SetAlgoLined

\KwResult{The global threshold}

Find the threshold correspond to the maximum $\sigma_b^2(t)$
\caption{Otsu's method for global thresholding}
\label{alg:otsu-thresh}
\end{algorithm}
\subsection{Local thresholding method}
The major problem with global thresholding is that it considers only the intensity, not any relationships between the pixels or any local characteric. The global thresholding can't handle changing illumination. It can give poor results for certain types of images. And the pixels identified by the thresholding process are not at all continuous. By applying local approach, we can overcome some of the problems.

Local thresholding divide an image into sub-images by a sliding window. For each sub-image, we find its global threshold. If the region is constant, consider it against a global threshold (all black or white). If there is sufficient variance, use Otsu/Iterative method in the window. 

Generally speaking, the local threshold is set according to the local mean and local variance.
$$
T_{local} = a\cdot\mu_{local} + b\cdot\sigma_{local}
$$
in which the coefficient $a$ for $\mu_{local}$ and the coefficient $b$ for $\sigma_{local}$ is decided according the illumiation gradience or by experience.
\subsection{Component tree based thresholding} \label{sec:thresh-cptree}
When the image is slightly complex, the limitation of thresholding methods becomes very obvious. We always can't use a single threshold to get the objects we are interested, especially when there are multiply objects, where each object lies in different gray levels. In such case, some objects will get miss-segmented or half-segmented. Another example is when the background is not evenly distributed, such as vignetting background, which is due to uneven illumination, or linear background. One single threshold will inevitably divide the background area into foreground area.

Even though the local thresholding can overcome some of the problem in global thresholding, but it is not easy to decide the size of sliding windows and the coefficients. In our paper, we use a much advanced method which considers all possible thresholds. We will get all possible connected-component in different threshols. The relationship between connected-component is either inclusion or non-overlap. So we can build a tree, called component tree, to manage the relationship for all connected-component. 

With component tree, we don't have to bother about the best threshold. We can filter out the components with certain size, which is obtained from a piori knowledge. The details about component tree will be introduce in chapter \ref{chapter:cptree}.

\section{Snake: Active contour method}
\subsection{Overview}
The active contour model\cite{kass1988snakes} (also called snake model) is popular in computer vision, which finds the object boundarys either continous or non-continuous. It is greatly used in application like image segmentation, object tracking, shape recognition, edge detection, and stereo matching.

A snake in the image is a lot of discrete points, which is called a spline.
$$
v_i = (x_i, y_i)
$$
where $i=0\ldots n-1$. The snake is guided by many forces which maybe external forces from the image gradience or the internal forces from the snake curve itself. When balance, the snake will be guided to the image boundaris and stopped.

To describe the snake state, each state (position) of the snake has an energy, which is the sum of external energy and internal energy, corresponding to it. The internal energy $E_{int}$ of the spline (snake) is due to bending. Then external energy $E_{ext}$ consist of the image forces $E_{img}$ acting on spline and the constrainted forces $E_{con}$ introduced by user. 

$$
E_{snake} = \int_0^1E_{snake}(v(s))ds = \int_0^1(E_{ext} + E_{int})ds
$$
$$
E_{ext} = E_{img} + E_{con}
$$

\textbf{Internal energy: } The bending forces of the snake come from the curve length and curve curvature.
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:int-energy}
E_{int} = (\alpha(s)|v_s(s)|^2 + \beta(s)|v_{ss}(s)|^2)/2
\end{equation}
where $\alpha(s)$ and $\beta(s)$ controls the energy sensitive to snake stretching and curve roundness, $|v_s(s)|^2$ represents the snake length and $|v_{ss}(s)|^2$ represents the total curvature. The larger the value of $\alpha(s)$, the more sensitive of the internal energy as the snake stretches. And the larger the value of $\beta(s)$, the more sensitive of the internal enerygy as the curve increase.
\textbf{Image forces: } The forces has three components that is lines, edges and terminations.
$$
E_{img} = w_{line}E_{line} + w_{edge}E_{edge} + w_{term}E_{term}
$$
The line component is just the intensity of the image.
$$
E_{line} = I(x,y)
$$
Edges in the images will make the snake attract to the area with large image gradients.
$$
E_{edge} = -|\nabla I(x,y)|^2
$$
Or the edge computed on the gaussian blured image,
$$
E_{edge} = -|G_\sigma \cdot \nabla^2 I|^2
$$
The termination component of energy can be defined as
$$
E_{term} = \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial n_\perp} = \frac{C_{yy}C_x^2 - 2C_{xy}C_xC_y + C_{xx}C_y^2}{(C_x^2 + C_y^2)^{3/2}}
$$
where $C(x,y)$ is the gaussian smoothed image on $I(x,y)$, $C_x$ and $C_y$ are gradient along $x$ and $y$, $C_{xx}$, $C_{xy}$, and $C_{yy}$ are second order gradients. This component is used to detect corners and terminations in an image.

\textbf{Constraint energy: } In some systems, the user interaction on the snake can guide the snake towards or away from particular features. 
\subsection{Energy minimization model}
The snake will move toward the energy decreasing direction. One of the simplest optimization method is gradient-descent minization\cite{snyman2005practical}. The energy of the snake can be estimated by using the discrete points on the snake. 
$$
E_{snake} \approx \sum_1^nE_{snake}(\bar{v}_i)
$$
Thus the devirative of the energy is approximate to
$$
\nabla E_{snake} \approx \sum_1^n \nabla E_{snake}(\bar{v}_i)
$$
Now applying the gradient descent minimization, the position of the snake is adjust as,
$$
\bar{v}_i = \bar{v}_i - \nabla E_{snake}(\bar{v}_i)
$$
This equation is applied iteratively until the energy doesn't change.
\subsection{Other implementations}
The classic snake modes which driven the snake towards object contours depends very much on the initial snake position.
The initial snake position should be close to the object or intercross with object boundary. Otherwise, the snake may
get stuck in local minima states and mis-finding the object. To overcome the initial position problem, many variations
based on snake model are proposed.

\textbf{GVF active contours: } In normal snake modes, the diffuse forces exist only on the object boundary. This 
makes the snake hard to converge to the object boundary. Due to this reason, the GVF active contour proposed a way to diffuse
the edge force to its surrounding, which provides a new external field. Under such model, even if the snake is started far from the object, it still gets attracted 
towards the object\cite{xu1998snakes}.

\textbf{Balloon snake: } The ballon snake \cite{kass1988snakes} behaves like a blowing ballnoon. When it passes by strong contour, it stops. Thus, the
initial snake need not to be too close to the object. The external field is modified and a new pressure force is introduced to make the curve evolve like a ballon.

\textbf{Diffusion snakes: } The diffusion snake \cite{cremers2002diffusion} is modified from Mumford-Shah \cite{mumford2006optimal} for spline contours. It is used 
when the prior shape information is known. The obtained segmentation maximizes both the Grey value homogeneity in the separated regions and the similarity of the contour with respect to a set of training shapes.

\textbf{Geometric Active Contours: } Geometric active \cite{malladi1995shape} proposed an energy function by summing up the snake perimeter and an inversed edge function. Through minimizing the energy function, the snake moves towards the perimeter shrinking direction and stops at the high edge area. The model may be implemented using level sets, which will be introduced in next section. For the model, the snake can be initialized relatively large to enclose the objects.
